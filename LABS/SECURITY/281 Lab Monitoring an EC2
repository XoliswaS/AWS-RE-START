📊 Lab 281: Monitoring an EC2 Instance


📌 Overview


In this lab, I learned how to monitor an Amazon EC2 instance to understand its performance, availability, and resource usage.

Monitoring is important because it helps detect issues early and ensures that applications run reliably in the cloud.



This lab introduced me to basic monitoring concepts used in real-world AWS environments.





🎯 Lab Objectives


By completing this lab, I was able to:

Verify that an EC2 instance is running

View monitoring metrics

Understand CPU utilization data

Set up basic monitoring alerts

Interpret EC2 performance information

🛠️ What I Did (Step by Step)


1️⃣ Verifying the EC2 Instance


I started by confirming that the EC2 instance was running in the AWS Management Console.


2️⃣ Viewing Monitoring Metrics


I navigated to the monitoring section of the EC2 instance to view performance metrics such as CPU usage and network activity


3️⃣ Analyzing CPU Utilization


I focused on CPU utilization to understand how much processing power the instance was using over time.


3️⃣ Analyzing CPU Utilization


I focused on CPU utilization to understand how much processing power the instance was using over time.

4️⃣ Creating a Monitoring Alarm


I created a basic alarm to notify when CPU usage exceeded a defined threshold.

This demonstrated how alerts can be used to detect performance issues.


⚠️ Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned


🔹 Understanding Metrics


At first, interpreting the graphs was challenging, but learning what each metric represents made it clearer.



🔹 Alert Configuration


Choosing appropriate thresholds showed me how monitoring must be tailored to application needs.



🔹 Importance of Monitoring


This lab highlighted how monitoring helps maintain system reliability and performance.
