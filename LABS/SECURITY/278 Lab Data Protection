🔐 Lab 278: Data Protection


📌 Overview


In this lab, I learned the importance of protecting data and how data protection is applied in IT and cloud environments.

The lab focused on understanding how data can be secured, backed up, and protected from unauthorized access or loss.



This lab helped me understand why data protection is critical for maintaining security, privacy, and reliability in cloud systems.





🎯 Lab Objectives


By completing this lab, I was able to:

Understand the concept of data protection

Identify different types of data

Apply access control to protect data

Understand basic encryption concepts

Verify data backup and recovery methods

🛠️ What I Did (Step by Step)


1️⃣ Understanding Data Types and Classification


I started by reviewing different types of data and how they are classified.

This helped me understand which data requires higher levels of protection.



2️⃣ Applying Access Controls


I reviewed and applied access control rules to ensure that only authorized users could access sensitive data.


3️⃣ Understanding Encryption


I explored how encryption protects data by making it unreadable to unauthorized users, both at rest and in transit.




4️⃣ Verifying Data Backup


I confirmed that data was backed up correctly and could be recovered if needed.

This demonstrated how backups protect data from accidental loss or system failure.




⚠️ Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned


🔹 Understanding Security Concepts


Some data protection concepts were new, but practical examples made them easier to understand.



🔹 Importance of Access Control


This lab showed how improper access settings can expose sensitive data.



🔹 Data Loss Prevention


I learned how backups and encryption work together to protect important information.

✅ Key Skills Gained
Understanding data protection principles

Applying access controls

Recognizing the role of encryption

Verifying data backups

Understanding security best practices

🧠 Reflection


This lab helped me understand how data protection is a core responsibility in cloud computing.

The concepts learned here are directly applicable to AWS services such as IAM, S3 encryption, and backup solutions.
