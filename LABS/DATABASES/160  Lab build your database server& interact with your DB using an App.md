🗄️ Lab 160: Your Database Server & Interact With Your DB Using an App


📌 Overview


In this lab, I learned how to set up a database server, connect it to an application, and interact with the database through the app.

The goal was to understand how databases work together with applications in a real AWS environment.



This lab helped me see how data is stored, retrieved, and managed behind the scenes in cloud-based applications.



🎯 Lab Objectives


By completing this lab, I was able to:

Create and configure a database server

Understand database connection settings

Connect an application to the database

Insert data into the database using the app

Retrieve and view stored data

Understand how apps interact with databases


🛠️ What I Did (Step by Step)


1️⃣ Creating the Database Server


I started by creating a database server using the lab environment.

This included choosing the database type and configuring basic settings such as the database name, username, and password.




2️⃣ Configuring Database Connection Settings


I reviewed the database connection details, including:

Endpoint / hostname

Port number

Database name

Login credentials



These details are required for an application to connect to the database.




3️⃣ Connecting the Application to the Database


Next, I configured the application to connect to the database by entering the correct connection details.

Once configured, the app was able to communicate with the database server successfully.


4️⃣ Inserting Data Using the Application


Using the application interface, I added new records to the database.

This demonstrated how applications send data to a database for storage.


5️⃣ Retrieving and Viewing Data


After inserting data, I confirmed that the information was stored correctly by viewing it through the application.

This showed how data can be retrieved from the database and displayed to users.


⚠️ Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned


🔹 Connection Errors


At first, the application could not connect to the database due to incorrect connection details.

Carefully checking the endpoint and credentials resolved the issue.



🔹 Understanding Database Concepts


It took some time to understand how the app communicates with the database, but seeing data flow between them made the concept clearer.



🔹 Importance of Configuration


This lab showed me how small configuration mistakes can prevent an entire application from working.

✅ Key Skills Gained
Setting up a database server

Configuring database connection details

Connecting an app to a database

Inserting and retrieving data

Understanding application-database interaction

🧠 Reflection


This lab helped me understand the relationship between applications and databases in the cloud.

It showed me how backend systems store and manage data and how important databases are in real-world applications such as e-commerce and web platforms.
