🧩 Lab 253: Challenge – Bash Shell Scripting


📌 Overview


In this challenge lab, I applied my knowledge of Bash shell scripting to automate tasks in a Linux environment.

The goal was to create and run shell scripts that perform actions automatically, helping reduce manual work and improve efficiency.



This lab strengthened my understanding of how scripting is used in real-world system administration and cloud environments.





🎯 Lab Objectives


By completing this challenge, I was able to:

Create a Bash shell script

Use variables and basic commands

Apply execution permissions to a script

Run the script from the terminal

Verify script output



🛠️ What I Did (Step by Step)


1️⃣ Creating the Bash Script


I created a new shell script file and added the appropriate shebang to indicate that the script should run using Bash.


2️⃣ Adding Script Logic


Inside the script, I added commands and variables to perform the required tasks.

This showed how multiple Linux commands can be combined into one automated script.


3️⃣ Setting Execution Permissions


By default, scripts are not executable.

I updated the file permissions so the script could be run directly from the terminal.




4️⃣ Running the Script


After setting the correct permissions, I executed the script from the command line and observed how it performed the tasks automatically.




5️⃣ Verifying the Output


I reviewed the output produced by the script to confirm that it ran successfully and completed all required steps.




⚠️ Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned


🔹 Script Errors


Small mistakes such as missing commands or incorrect syntax caused errors.

Carefully reviewing the script helped resolve these issues.



🔹 Permission Issues


Forgetting to make the script executable prevented it from running.

This reinforced the importance of Linux file permissions.



🔹 Debugging


Running the script step by step made it easier to identify and fix problems.

✅ Key Skills Gained
Writing basic Bash scripts

Using variables and commands

Managing file permissions

Automating tasks with scripts

Debugging shell scripts

🧠 Reflection


This challenge helped me understand how Bash scripting can automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency in cloud and Linux environments.

It was a valuable skill that connects directly to system administration and DevOps practices.
