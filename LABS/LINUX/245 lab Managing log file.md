📄 Lab 245: Managing Log Files


📌 Overview


In this lab, I learned how to view, manage, and analyze log files on a Linux system.

Log files are important because they help administrators monitor system activity, troubleshoot issues, and track application behavior.



This lab focused on understanding where logs are stored, how to read them, and how to manage large log files efficiently.





🎯 Lab Objectives


By completing this lab, I was able to:

Identify common Linux log file locations

View log file contents using command-line tools

Monitor logs in real time

Search log files for specific entries

Manage and control log file size

🛠️ What I Did (Step by Step)


1️⃣ Locating Log Files


I navigated to the /var/log directory, which is where most system and application log files are stored on Linux systems.




2️⃣ Viewing Log File Contents


I used command-line tools to read log files without modifying them.

This helped me safely inspect logs and understand system activity.


3️⃣ Monitoring Logs in Real Time


To observe live system activity, I monitored logs as new entries were added.

This is useful when troubleshooting issues as they happen.
