 Lab 266: Troubleshooting Network Issues


📌 Overview


In this lab, I practiced identifying and troubleshooting common network issues that can affect connectivity between systems and applications.

The focus was on understanding how to systematically diagnose problems using basic networking tools and logical troubleshooting steps.



This lab helped me understand how networking problems occur and how to resolve them efficiently in real-world IT and cloud environments.



🎯 Lab Objectives


By completing this lab, I was able to:

Identify common network connectivity problems

Verify network configuration settings

Test connectivity between systems

Check firewall or security restrictions

Resolve basic network issues




🛠️ What I Did (Step by Step)


1️⃣ Verifying Network Configuration


I started by checking the system’s network configuration to ensure it had a valid IP address, subnet, and gateway.


2️⃣ Testing Network Connectivity


I tested connectivity to other systems and external resources to confirm whether the network connection was working


3️⃣ Checking Firewall and Security Settings


I reviewed firewall or security rules to confirm that required network traffic was allowed and not being blocked.


4️⃣ Identifying the Root Cause


By reviewing the results from each test, I identified where the network issue was occurring and what was causing the failure.




5️⃣ Resolving the Network Issue


I applied the necessary changes to fix the issue and verified that network connectivity was restored successfully.




⚠️ Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned


🔹 Misconfigured Network Settings


Incorrect network configuration caused connectivity issues.

This highlighted the importance of verifying settings step by step.



🔹 Blocked Network Traffic


Firewall rules initially prevented communication, reinforcing the need to review security controls carefully.



🔹 Structured Troubleshooting


Following a logical troubleshooting process made it easier to find and resolve the issue.

✅ Key Skills Gained
Diagnosing network connectivity issues

Verifying network configurations

Testing and validating connections

Understanding firewall and security impacts

Applying systematic troubleshooting methods

🧠 Reflection


This lab showed me how important a structured approach to network troubleshooting is.

The skills I practiced are directly applicable to cloud environments, especially when working with AWS networking components such as VPCs and security groups.
