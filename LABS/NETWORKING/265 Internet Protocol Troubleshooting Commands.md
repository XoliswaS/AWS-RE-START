🌐 Lab 265: Internet Protocol Troubleshooting Commands


📌 Overview


In this lab, I learned how to use Internet Protocol (IP) troubleshooting commands to diagnose and resolve basic network connectivity issues.

These commands are essential for understanding how devices communicate over a network and for identifying where connection problems occur.



This lab helped me build confidence in network troubleshooting, which is a key skill for cloud and IT professionals.



🎯 Lab Objectives


By completing this lab, I was able to:

Check IP address configuration

Test network connectivity

Trace the network path to a destination

Verify DNS name resolution

Understand common network troubleshooting tools

🛠️ What I Did (Step by Step)


1️⃣ Checking IP Address Information


I checked the system’s IP address and network configuration to confirm that the device was properly connected to the network.


2️⃣ Testing Connectivity with Ping


I used a connectivity test to verify whether my system could reach another device or website over the network.


3️⃣ Tracing the Network Path


I traced the route that network traffic takes to reach a destination.

This helped me identify where delays or failures might be occurring.
4️⃣ Verifying DNS Resolution


I checked whether domain names were correctly resolving to IP addresses.

This helped determine if issues were related to DNS configuration.


⚠️ Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned


🔹 No Response from Destination


Some destinations did not respond, which helped me understand that firewalls or security rules can block network traffic.



🔹 Understanding Network Paths


Interpreting the traceroute output took time, but it improved my understanding of how data travels across networks.



🔹 DNS Issues


I learned that even when a network connection exists, DNS problems can still prevent access to websites.

✅ Key Skills Gained
Checking IP configuration

Testing network connectivity

Tracing network routes

Troubleshooting DNS issues

Understanding basic networking concepts

🧠 Reflection


This lab showed me how IP troubleshooting commands are essential for diagnosing network issues in both local and cloud environments.

These skills are directly applicable to AWS networking services such as VPCs, subnets, and security groups.
